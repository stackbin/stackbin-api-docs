# Stackbin API Docs

This is a copy of the files used to generate the Stackbin API documentation at https://developers.stkbn.com/. It can be followed to see changes in our API documentation over time.

We appreciate bug reports and proposals for changes to our API docs, but because this is a mirror of an internal repository we cannot directly merge pull requests.

For help with the Stackbin API please open a help request.

For updates and questions follow @stackbin on Twitter.
